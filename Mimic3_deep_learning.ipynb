Acute renal failure.\\n2.  Resolving urinary tract infection, status post klebsiella\\nurosepsis.\\n3.  Prolonged ventilator dependence.\\n4.  Status post [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome.\\n5.  Diabetes mellitus.\\n\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mrs. [**Known lastname 20728**] is a 75-year-old\\nfemale with a history of insulin dependent diabetes,\\nhypertension, morbid obesity, coronary artery disease, status\\npost three vessel coronary artery bypass graft in [**2188-3-25**], paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, congestive heart\\nfailure with normal ejection fraction who was transferred\\nfrom [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation and therapy of acute\\nrenal failure, [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome and persistent ventilator\\ndependence with metabolic acidosis and resolving Klebsiella\\nurosepsis.\\n\\nPatient initially presented to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2188-3-14**] for evaluation of congestive heart\\nfailure and was found to have severe three vessel disease by\\ncardiac catheterization.  She underwent three vessel coronary\\nartery bypass graft on the [**3-18**] with initial\\npostoperative complication of pneumonia and urinary tract\\ninfection that were treated with Ciprofloxacin.  She was then\\ntransferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further rehabilitation\\non the [**2-28**].  There, she developed left lower lobe\\npneumonia and sternal wound infection/dehiscence which grew\\nout staphylococcus and enterococcus.  She was started on\\nlevofloxacin and vancomycin, and then transferred back to the\\nSICU at [**Hospital3 **] on [**4-1**] for further evaluation and\\nmanagement.  There, she was found to have a left pleural\\neffusion that required placement of a chest tube.  On the\\n[**4-3**], she was taken to the Operating Room for\\ndebridement and flap reconstruction over her sternal wound.\\nHer postoperative course after this procedure was complicated\\nby pressor requirements, persistent hypoxia and metabolic\\nalkalosis of unclear etiology treated with diamox.  Also, she\\nfailed extubation and underwent a percutaneous tracheostomy\\non the [**4-18**], and several bronchoscopies were\\nsignificant only for chronic inflammatory changes.  During\\nthis period, she also developed left arm weakness which was\\nevaluated by Neurology.  Their differential was a brachial\\nplexopathy versus cord injury versus a right MCA stroke.\\n\\nShe was discharged at [**Hospital1 **] again on the [**4-23**] with a PICC line in place and her flaps intact.  Her\\ntotal course of intravenous vancomycin was scheduled for six\\nweeks.\\n\\nWhile at the rehabilitation facility, she developed multiple\\nmedical issues that complicated her management.\\n1.  [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome:  On [**5-6**], she developed increasing\\nabdominal distention, discomfort and occasional emesis on\\ntube feeds.  Gastrointestinal evaluated her the [**5-13**]\\nand recommended bowel arrest, rectal and nasogastric tube\\ndecompression.  A KUB on [**5-19**] showed that the cecum was\\nstill dilated to 16.5 cm and so she was continued NPO.  Her\\nexam had no improved at the time of transfer to Medical\\nIntensive Care Unit.\\n[**Unit Number **].  Klebsiella urosepsis:  Patient apparently had\\nintermittent temperature spikes with leukocytosis concerning\\nfor continued sternal wound infection.  Vancomycin was\\ncontinued past the six week course but on [**5-19**], she was\\nstarted on levofloxacin and Flagyl for broader coverage.  The\\nFlagyl was begun for concern of toxic megacolon.  On [**5-22**],\\nboth urine and [**2-27**] blood culture bottles grew out generally\\npansensitive Klebsiella pneumonia.  She was given a single\\ndose of gentamicin on the 28th and vancomycin was\\ndiscontinued secondary to worsening renal failure.\\nLevofloxacin and Flagyl were continued.  At the time of\\ntransfer back to the Medical Intensive Care Unit, it was felt\\nthat her sepsis was resolving.\\n3.  Acute renal failure:  Creatinine on [**5-15**] was 0.8.  On\\n[**5-22**], it was 3.0 and on [**5-26**] was 5.0.  While at [**Hospital1 5593**], she was seen by the renal attending Dr.\\n[**Last Name (STitle) **].  Her urinalysis at the time was notable for granular\\ncasts.  It was the feeling of the renal team, that Mrs.\\n[**Known lastname 20728**] had developed acute renal failure secondary to acute\\ntubular necrosis induced by sepsis and intravascular\\ndepletion.  She was started on a Lasix drip and renal dosed\\ndopamine.  The documentation is unclear, but she appears to\\nhave been anuric for some time but on the [**6-23**], her\\nurine output is noted to be 300-400 cc.  While she was at the\\nrehabilitation facility, an ultrasound was obtained that\\nshowed no evidence of hydronephrosis but there was a question\\nof horseshoe kidney.\\n4.  Ventilatory dependence:  The patient has been unable to\\nbe weaned off the ventilator for unclear reasons.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.9\\n(rectal).  Heart rate 64.  Blood pressure 117/42.\\nRespiratory rate 14.  Oxygen saturation 100% ventilatory\\nsetting:  SIMV 14/750/5/5/30%.  General:  She was alert and\\noriented times three in no acute distress.  The tracheostomy\\nwas in place and she was able to respond to verbal commands.\\nHead, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils equal, round and\\nreactive to light.  The extraocular movements were intact.\\nThe oropharynx was moist.  There was no sinus tenderness and\\nan nasogastric tube was in place in the right naris.\\nCardiovascular:  The heart had a regular rhythm and normal\\nrate.  No appreciable murmurs, rubs or gallops were\\nauscultated.  Pulmonary:  Rhonchus breath sounds bilaterally\\nwith upper airway secretion, no wheezes, no crackles.\\nAbdominal exam:  Obese, moderately distended, diffusely\\ntender, no rebound, no guarding, scant bowel sounds, right\\nlongitudinal surgical wound with inferior aspect wound and\\npacked with mild erythema.  Midline longitudinal surgical\\nwith subxiphoid aspect open and packed. Extremities:  3+\\npitting edema with venous stasis changes in both lower\\nextremities.  Pulses in feet barely palpable but warm.\\nNeurological:  Strong grasp right hand, weak grasp left hand.\\nCan wiggle toes, but cannot move legs.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 10.8, hematocrit\\n27.4, platelets 184,000, PT 15.3, PTT 29.6, INR 1.5, sodium\\n126, potassium 2.9, chloride 93, bicarbonate 16, BUN 88,\\ncreatinine 5.2, anion gap 17, calcium 7.5, magnesium 1.8,\\nphosphorus 5.6.  Arterial blood gases 7.45/25/131.  KUB:  No\\nair fluid levels, no free air, no cecal dilation noted.\\n\\nChest x-ray:  Persistent left lower lobe collapse with\\nconsolidation and left pleural effusion.  Cannot exclude\\ninfectious etiology.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\\n\\n1.  Pulmonary:  The patient was brought to [**Hospital3 **] on\\nSIMV for unclear reasons.  A tracheostomy was in place and\\nshe was quickly changed over to pressure support ventilation,\\npressure support of 10.  PEEP 7.5, FIO2 40% which she\\ntolerated very well.  She was also given Atrovent nebulizers\\nevery six hours.  This appeared to lower her plateau\\npressures.  On [**5-29**], she was placed on a trachea mask and\\nwas able to tolerate that for two hours, though she did\\ndemonstrate a thoracoabdominal breathing pattern.  Through\\nthe rest of her admission, the trachea mask trials were\\nadvanced on a daily basis.  By [**6-3**], she was able to go\\nsix hours on 50% trachea mask with no signs of distress or\\ndiscomfort.\\n\\n2.  Renal failure:   Mrs. [**Known lastname 20728**] was closely followed by the\\nMedical Intensive Care Unit Team and the Renal consult team.\\nIt was the feeling of all involved, that most of her acute\\nrenal failure at this point was due to acute tubular\\nnecrosis.  In support of this, she had muddy brown casts in\\nher urine, a urine sodium of 69 and a calculated FeNA of\\ngreater than 1.  Her Lasix strip was discontinued upon\\nadmission to our Medical Intensive Care Unit.  However, she\\ncontinues to generate a good urine output, approximately 50\\ncc per hour without any diuretic support.  In addition to\\nthis, the patient appeared to have a nongap metabolic\\nacidosis.  Electrolyte studies were sent away on the urine\\nand stool and they suggested renal wasting of bicarbonate,\\ntherefore, the patient was started on a bicarbonate drip D5W\\nwith three amps of sodium bicarbonate to replete bicarbonate\\nlosses.  On admission, her bicarbonate was 16.  By [**5-31**],\\nthe bicarbonate was 18 and on [**6-3**], it was 25.  Because\\nshe was generating a good urine output, there was no need for\\nacute dialysis.  Our volume goals with her were to maintain\\neuvolemia.  However, the creatinine trended up from 5.2 on\\nadmission ([**5-27**]) to 6.1 on [**6-2**].  On [**6-3**], the creatinine\\nwas down to 5.8.  Throughout her admission she has not\\nexperienced oliguria, and we have mainly given her supportive\\ncare in this regard.  Central venous line was placed early in\\nthe admission and we have been following CVPs in her to help\\nguide for volume repletion.  The central venous pressure to\\nwhich she has appeared to respond well is between 10 and 12.\\nStudy of the urine sediment revealed only rare urine\\neosinophils, no white blood cell casts, no red blood cell\\ncasts to suggest a glomerulonephritis or tubular interstitial\\nnephritis.  A renal ultrasound was obtained which showed the\\nright lower pole of the kidney going inferiorly and towards\\nthe midline, however, this study was limited by the patient's\\nbody habitus and immobility.  A question still remains as to\\nwhether she has abnormal renal anatomy.\\n\\n3.  Infectious Disease:  The patient was transferred to our\\nMedical Intensive Care Unit with resolving Klebsiella\\nurosepsis.   She received levofloxacin at 250 mg q.o.d. until\\n[**5-29**].  Her urine culture grew out multiple drug resistant\\nKlebsiella and pneumonia.  This pathogen was resistant to\\nCiprofloxacin and levofloxacin, but was sensitive to third\\ngeneration cephalosporins and Bactrim.  On [**5-30**], she was\\nstarted on Bactrim with a planned duration of therapy of 14\\ndays.  Surveillance urinalyses have subsequently revealed\\npyuria in the setting of Bactrim therapy.  On [**6-1**], the\\nurinalysis showed positive nitrate and 260 white blood cells\\nper high powered field.  On [**6-3**], the nitrates were\\nnegative but she had 86 white blood cells per high powered\\nfield.  This raises the question of a possible genitourinary\\ntract abnormality predisposing her to developing resistant\\ninfections, however, it is also possible that her initial\\nKlebsiella infection was cleared with levofloxacin and she\\nbecame subsequently reinfected with a resistant strain of\\nKlebsiella.\\n\\nThe patient was also noted to have a sputum Gram stain that\\nshowed no polymorphonuclear leukocytes but did show [**11-27**]+ gram\\nnegative rods.  A subsequent sputum culture grew out sparse\\nPseudomonas aeruginosa that is pansensitive.  However, in\\nlight of the lack of inflammation on the sputum Gram stain,\\nwe have treated this as colonization of the airways.  We have\\nalso followed serial sputum Gram stains to detect an evolving\\ninflammation in the airways but as of date of discharge, no\\ninflammation has been noted.\\n\\nThe patient has remained afebrile with a stable white blood\\ncell count between 11 and 12,000 throughout her admission.\\n\\n4.  Gastrointestinal:  1) [**Last Name (un) 3696**] syndrome.  The patient\\nwas evaluated serially with KUBs which were normal.  Her\\nclinical exam improved significantly within the first three\\ndays of her admission here.  She was started on a small dose\\nof Reglan and tube feeds were begun.  No notable residuals\\nhave occurred as she is now at her target rate of 35 cc per\\nhour of Nepro.  Flagyl was discontinued after two C.\\ndifficile toxin titers were negative and the patient showed\\nno clinical evidence of toxic megacolon or antibiotic related\\ndiarrhea.\\n\\n5.  Diabetes mellitus:  Blood sugar control has been\\ndifficult in Mrs. [**Known lastname 20728**] for several days as she was\\nreceiving both parenteral and enteral nutrition and her blood\\nsugars trended up into the high 300s requiring 40 mg\\nsubcutaneous b.i.d. of NPH insulin plus 40 units of regular\\ninsulin and her TPN bag and up to 52 units of regular\\nsubcutaneous insulin off a sliding scale.  However, once the\\nTPN was discontinued after we felt comfortable that her\\ngastrointestinal tract was handling the tube feedings, the\\nblood sugars trended down to the mid 200s.  Her NPH was\\nsubsequently advanced to 45 units subcutaneous b.i.d. and her\\nblood sugars have remained under 200 since.\\n\\n6.  Acidosis:  The patient, as discussed above, was admitted\\nwith a nongap metabolic acidosis.  The source of bicarbonate\\nloss appeared to be the kidneys secondary to renal failure.\\nHowever, at the time of discharge, her bicarbonate is stable\\nat 25 requiring no bicarbonate repletion.\\n\\n7.  Wound care:  The patient was seen by Plastic Surgery here\\nwho agreed with supportive care of the subxiphoid and right\\nabdominal open wounds.  The management has consisted of\\nwet-to-dry sterile packing and dressings twice a day.\\nGranulation tissue has come in over the time of her admission\\nin the Medical Intensive Care Unit, the minimal erythema\\nsurrounding the wounds have resolved.  Granulation tissue has\\ncome in to both wounds.  There is little to no purulent\\ndrainage from either wound.  The patient also has stasis\\ndermatitis over both lower extremities and several stasis\\nulcers.  She has grade 2 skin breakdown over the ischial\\nregion and a small ulcer over her left heel.  The patient has\\nbeen kept in a pneumatic mattress to minimize progression of\\ndecubitus ulcers.  She has also received antibiotic ointments\\nand dressings to prevent infection in these areas.\\n\\n8.  Physical Therapy:  While the patient was in the Medical\\nIntensive Care Unit, Physical Therapy was formally consulted.\\nIt was there feeling that she is in a severely deconditioned\\nstate, secondary to her prolonged stay in medical settings\\nand lack of mobility.  She was begun on a regimen of upper\\nand lower extremity exercises.  She has also been up and out\\nof bed twice a day.\\n\\n9.  Lines:  The patient comes with a left subclavian line\\nthat was put in eight days prior to discharge.  With no\\nevidence of bacteremia and no clinical evidence of blood\\nstream infection, this line has been left in.  The patient is\\noff parenteral nutrition.\\n\\n10. Psychiatric:  By both the nurses report and her sister's\\nreport, the patient is chronically withdrawn and depressed.\\nWe have advanced her Zoloft to 100 mg q.d. and we have\\nencouraged her family to come visit her often.  Her\\nmotivation will be an important part of her recovery,\\nespecially in terms of weaning her from the ventilator.  This\\nissue will need further follow-up in rehabilitation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                          [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 3090**], M.D.\\n[**MD
